This script has been set up in hopes it will allow me to properly set up a pathfinder for point-and-click-adventures.
*if* Kthura would ever see the light for my Love2D builder this pathfinder will definitely serve as one of its core-features 
(as a 3rd party module was also used in the original BlitzMax version of Kthura).
Things have not yet been fully decided here, because stuff is still being investigated.

For the original github repository of this pathfinder please visit: https://github.com/lewtds/pathfinder.lua
