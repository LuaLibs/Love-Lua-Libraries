# Love Lua Libraries

These "Libraries" have been set up to use with my [LoveBuilder](https://github.com/Tricky1975/BuildLove).
I use Love2D for my smaller projects, but these libraries can be pretty important.


Most libs have been written by me and are licensed under the zlib license.
I gotta note that the MD5 library is not mine, but it blends in perfectly with this system.
