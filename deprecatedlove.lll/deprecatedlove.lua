     You may call me lazy or whatever you want, but I simply
     can't keep modifying all my source whenever a command is
     removed from Love2D, so whenever a command gets deprecated
     or removed, it may end up here in order to keep my games
     running in newer versions of Love2D if this is required.
     
     I started using Love2D as of version 0.10.1
     We will see how stuff goes after that. ;)
